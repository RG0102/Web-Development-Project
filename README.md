The Local Pharmacy Website is a web development project that utilizes HTML, CSS, PHP, and JavaScript to create a comprehensive online platform for a local pharmacy. The project includes key functionalities such as a login page, sign-up page, and contact page, which are implemented using PHP.

The website consists of multiple HTML pages, including a home page, about page, product page, and contact page. These pages are designed and developed using HTML and CSS, ensuring an attractive and user-friendly interface. The home page provides an overview of the pharmacy's services and highlights featured products, while the product page displays a range of available pharmaceutical products.

To enhance user experience and interactivity, JavaScript is utilized throughout the website. This allows for dynamic elements and functionality, such as image sliders, interactive forms, and client-side validation. I use Javascript for my product page, home page and contact page.

The login page and sign-up page are implemented using PHP, providing a secure and reliable user authentication system. Users can create an account, log in with their credentials, and access personalized features and services on the website. Additionally, the contact page incorporates PHP functionality to handle user inquiries and messages, ensuring effective communication between the pharmacy and its customers.
