    <h2>What is Blood Pressure?</h2>
    <p>Our blood pressure is measured by 2 numbers - systolic and diastolic.
       Systolic pressure is recorded when the heart muscle squeezes out the
       blood, and diastolic pressure is recorded when the heart relaxed and 
       the blood flows back into the heart.

       Normal blood pressure level is 120 (systolic) over 80 (diastolic).
    </p>

    <h2>Wny is it important to check?</h2>
    <p>It is important to check blood pressure as high bloof pressure increases
       your risk of a heart attack or stroke, heart failure and kidney failure.
